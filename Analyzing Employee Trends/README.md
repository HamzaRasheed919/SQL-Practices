# Analyzing Employee Trend
This project explores employee trends and behavior using SQL queries to analyze employee data from a fictional organization. The dataset, which is stored in a table called employee trends, contains information about employees, including their departments, job roles, education levels, job satisfaction, attrition rates, and more. The goal of this project was to extract key insights from the data to understand employee satisfaction, attrition, and other trends across different segments.

# Tools & Technologies:

- SQL (MySQL)

# Project Overview:
Using SQL queries, the project provides insights into various aspects of employee behavior, focusing on:

- Employee distribution across departments.
- Average age and job satisfaction within departments and job roles.
- Employee attrition rates by age and education level.
- Job satisfaction trends based on business travel frequency and marital status.

# Key SQL Queries & Insights:
- Employee Count by Department
- Average Age by Department
- Most Common Job Roles by Department
- Job Satisfaction by Education Level
- Average Age by Job Satisfaction
- Attrition Rate by Age Band
- Average Job Satisfaction by Department
- Attrition Rate by Education and Age Band
