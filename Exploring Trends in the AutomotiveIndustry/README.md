# Exploring Trends in the Automotive Industry
# Overview: 
This project involves a set of SQL queries that interact with an automotive database, aiming to extract insights into various aspects of car sales, including pricing, mileage, and transmission types. The database contains car information such as selling_price, mileage, transmission, owner, seats, and km_driven, among other attributes. These queries are designed to answer specific business questions related to car pricing, performance, and ownership details.
- Average Selling Price for Cars with Manual Transmission and First Owner, Grouped by Fuel
- Top 3 Car Models with the Highest Average Mileage for Cars with More than 5 Seats
- Car Models Where the Difference Between Maximum and Minimum Selling Prices is Greater
- Cars with Selling Price Above Overall Average and Mileage Below Overall Average
- Cumulative Sum of Selling Prices Over the Years for Each Car Model
- Cars with Selling Price Within 10% of the Average Selling Price
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Selling Prices for Each Car Model with a Smoothing
- Cars with Decrease in Selling Price Compared to the Previous Year
- Car Models with the Highest Total Mileage for Each Transmission Type
- Average Selling Price Per Year for the Top 3 Car Models with the Highest Overall Selling

These queries demonstrate the application of SQL techniques such as window functions (SUM() OVER, LAG()), aggregation (AVG(), MAX() and MIN()) to perform complex data analysis on a car sales dataset. By answering business questions related to price, mileage, and other car characteristics, this project provides valuable insights for automotive sales or business analytics.
